This macOS Sierra UI Kit is designed at 1x scale, but with retina displays in mind! So if you open this on a non-retina screen it may looks a little blurry. I think we're missing some good retina UI Kits for Mac, so I've created this based on Apple's fine retina display style. 

The Sketch document uses the latest features like Text Styles, Symbols and Auto Layout. **You can [download](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit/archive/master.zip) this Kit for FREE and use it to create your own retina ready designs!**  
Show some love if you like this UI kit and share it with your friends. :+1:

# Touch Bar Kit included
![Preview](Previews/Touch%20Bar%20Preview.jpg?raw=true)
New since version 1.1 is a UI Kit for the all new MacBook Pro Touch Bar. It includes common layouts from the [macOS HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/AbouttheTouchBar.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH104-SW1) and some system app layouts.

# Sketch Libraries
Both the macOS UI Kit and the Touch Bar Kit are perfectly suited for the new [Sketch Libraries](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/)! Just add it to your Libraries in the settings and start designing! (Sketch 47 required)

> The best design happens when designers collaborate together. With Libraries, designers can now share Symbols across documents and have them update to be always kept in sync.

# Need Help?
Take a look at the [Repo Wiki](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit/wiki) to read more about both of the UI Kits and how to use them.
