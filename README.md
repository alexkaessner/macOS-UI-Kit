This macOS Sierra UI Kit is designed at 1x scale, but with retina displays in mind! So if you open this on a non-retina screen it may looks a little blurry. I think we're missing some good retina UI Kits for Mac, so I've created this based on Apple's fine retina display style. 

The Sketch document uses the latest features like Text Styles, Symbols and Auto Layout. **You can [download](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit/archive/master.zip) this Kit for FREE and use it to create your own retina ready designs!**  
Show some love if you like this UI kit and share it with your friends. :+1:

# NOTE: macOS 11 Big Sur
Yes, Iâ€™m working on a big update for macOS 11. Stay tuned! :wink:

# Sketch Libraries
Both the macOS UI Kit and the Touch Bar Kit are perfectly suited for the new [Sketch Libraries](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/)! Just download the Libraries from Sketch Cloud (links above) or add it manually and start designing!

> The best design happens when designers collaborate together. With Libraries, designers can now share Symbols across documents and have them update to be always kept in sync.

# Touch Bar Kit included
![Preview](Previews/Touch%20Bar%20Preview.jpg?raw=true)
New since version 1.1 is a UI Kit for the all new MacBook Pro Touch Bar. It includes common layouts from the [macOS HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/AbouttheTouchBar.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH104-SW1) and some system app layouts.

# Need Help?
Take a look at the [Repo Wiki](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit/wiki) to read more about both of the UI Kits and how to use them.

# System requirements
**This UI Kit is made for Sketch 51 or higher.**  
If you need a file for a older Sketch version look out for [older UI Kit versions](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit/releases).
